# image-interpolation
The project aims to interpolate discontinues image sequences and generate new image sequence that can play at higher (30Hz) frequencey. Especially, the goal of this project aims to solve the image stitching problem when the depth of scene varies and affects the stitching results. The methods adopt here use K-means and Dual-homography. More information refer to the poster.pdf
